    <h3 class="assignment">Gaining access to the DahlgrenTest repository</h3>
    <p>
      These instructions are intended to help a beginner to gain access to the DahlgrenTest repository.
      <ul>
        <li>Go to <a href="github.com">GitHub.com</a> and sign up for an account.<br>
          <ul>
            <li>You need to create an handle for your account. Think of this like the call sign for a jet pilot.</li>
            <li>PLEASE consider that this handle might appear in an award write up one day. You want to be
              proud of that handle even if it expresses your personality. HeavyLifter might be okay. Pussycat69 is not.</li>
            <li>This handle is also the base of any repository you create for yourself, your resume, your portfolio, school work, etc.</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Use a permanent email account that you will have access to in the future.</li>
        <li>Go to your email and confirm your GitHub account.</li>
        <li>Send an email to Brian Dillon requesting access to the DahlgrenTest repo. Include your handle so that you can be granted access.</li>
        <li>From your GitHub page, download the desktop application that will let your push/pull code from the repository.</li>
      </ul>
