    <h3>Creating Artifacts</h3>
    <p>
      Within a job you can create an artifact. This is a great way to store data and 
      later retrieve it. These files only last a short time (90 days), but that is 
      long enough to be accessed if needed. There is a built in action for this and
      you can specify the name of the artifact that will be created.<br>
