    <h3>What is a fetch?</h3>
    <p>Any time your computer needs to get updated files from the
      server, you will want to complete a fetch. A fetch will 
      load/download files from the server, placing them on your 
      local machine so that you can work with the latest version
      of the repository.
    </p>
    <p>Use:</p>
    <p>If you're on the GitHub website editing code, you will not 
      have to worry about fetching as the website deals directly 
      with the server. Github Desktop Will tell you exactly when
      you need to fetch.
