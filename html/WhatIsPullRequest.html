    <h3>What is a Pull Request?</h3>
    <p>A pull request is any change that you want to take from one branch and
      apply it to another. This can sometimes result in conflicts, which can
      be resolved on the GitHub webpage, where you can select which portions
      of the code you would like to keep
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>Say you branch off and work on implementing some feature A, and your
      partner creates another branch to make some feature B
    </p>
    <p>You can merge these two branches together to make the two features on
      a single branch
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the two features are completely independent and don't get mixed
        together code-wise
        <ul>
          <li>Then a merge can be done without resolving any conflicts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>But, if there are some conflicts between the changes you and your 
        partner have made
        <ul>
          <li>Then you would need to resolve any conflicts that arose</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
