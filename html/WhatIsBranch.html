    <h3>What is a Branch?</h3>
    <p>While you're working on a project you will probably want to test something
      without affecting the code you already have. This is where a branch comes
      in handy, as they allow you to branch off and test out anything you are
      going to create.
    </p>
    <p>Use:</p>
    <p>Say there was a portion of code that works, but is slow or inefficient.
      You could use a create branch to work on that portion of code while
      keeping the original intact. If you couldn't figure out a better way,
      then you can just discard the branch. But, if you do find a better way,
      then you can create a "Pull Request" which will allow you, or someone else,
      to review the changes and pick one to go with.
    </p>
    <p>Quick Summary</p>
    <p>Scenario: Say you have code you want to edit, but you don't know if you'll
    want to keep the changes</p>
    <p>Create a branch, write and test the new code</p>
    <p>If you don't like the new code</p>
    <li>Discard the branch</li>
    <p>If you like the code</p>
    <li>Create a Pull Request to review the changes
      <ul>
        <li>Pick which version to keep</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
