    <h3>Creating a Test that Intentionally Fails</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Start by creating a test file like in the <a href="basic_test.html">basic test 
        tutorial.</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The way that you want to structure your test is so that the expected result
        is not what what your actual result will be. From the example in the basic test 
        tutorial, we set up x and y and then set the expected result to something other
        than x + y. Then, instead of having '==' for equality, we put '!='so that we get a
        positive result for the intentionally incorrect expected result.

      </li>
      <li>Here is what will be shown in the Actions page.

      </li>
      <li>This may not be exactly what you will have to do for each intentionally 
        failed unit test, but it gives you a basis for how to do it.
      </li>
    </ul>
