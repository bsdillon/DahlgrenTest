    <h3>List of useful actions</h3>
    <p>
      All of these actions have been used in the various workflow examples and may be useful again.
    </p>
    <h3>Checkout</h3>
    <p>
      Checkout is a standard action that copies all code from the repository into the build machine.
      This action will wipe out files that may have been created previously. Be careful to perform
      the checkout before creating any new files.<br>
      <code>
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      </code>
    </p>
    <h3>IP v4 and v6</h3>
    <p>
      IP addresses are sometimes desired and can be accessed by this action. The value can be 
      pulled out using the action and then saved to a file.<br>
      <code>
      - name: Public IP<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;id: ip<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;uses: haythem/public-ip@v1<br>
      - name: Print Public IP<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;run: |<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;echo ${{ steps.ip.outputs.ipv4 }} > IP2.txt
      </code>
    </p>
    <h3>Sleep</h3>
    <p>
      Sleep is occasionally needed to allow time for some other action to occur.
      While this is not the best way to code, the workflow syntax only allows
      sequential execution (i.e. no loops see <a href="https://github.community/t/creating-a-while-loop-in-workflow/119253">this discussion</a>) and delays can get around some of 
      these limitations. The time parameter follows the <a href="https://ss64.com/bash/sleep.html">linux sleep syntax</a>.<br>
      <code>
      - name: Wait for 5 seconds<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;uses: jakejarvis/wait-action@master<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;with:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time: '5s'
      </code>
    </p>
    <h3>Upload and Download Artifacts</h3>
    <p>
      These two actions use similar syntax to export artifacts. The path of the artifact is relative to the 
      execution location on the runner. The name of the artifact will be the zip file that contains that file.<br>
      <code>
      - name: Keep output file as artifact<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;uses: actions/download-artifact@v1<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;with:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: file_list<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path: out.txt
      </code>
    </p>
