    <h3>Installing OpenJDK onto Linux Virtual Machine</h3>
    <h4>Terminal Emmulator</h4>
     Open the Terminal Emmulator in the Linux Virtual Machine.
    
      

  <!--  
      Install the following libraries for operating GEMINI in QT Creator in the terminal:
    <ul>
      <li><code>sudo apt install gcc</code></li>
      <li><code>sudo apt install build-essential</code></li>
      <li><code>sudo apt-get -y install cmake</code></li>
      <li><code>sudo apt-get install libqt5websockets5-dev</code></li>
      <li><code>sudo apt install qtbase5-dev</code> (Disregard this library if an error arises.)</li>
      <li><code>sudo apt install g++</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, linux does not support GitHub desktop, so you have to install git with <code>sudo apt install git</code> in the terminal.
      Afterwards, clone the repository with <code>git clone https://github.com/bsdillon/DahlgrenTest.git</code> in any directory of your choosing.
      I did mine under Documents. To switch to a specific branch, use <code>git checkout 'existing branch'</code>. Use
      "GEMRefactor" for existing branch since all work for updated work on GEMINI is in this branch. Make sure you pull
      from the branch origin every now and then when it gets updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once everything is installed and git is setup, open QT Creator and click on "Open Project", and open "Gemini.pro" that
      is in the GEMINI folder. Stick with the default options after opening it.
      From there you can be able to view the workspace with all the GEMINI files in it.
    </p>
    <h4>Pycharm</h4>
    <p>Pycharm is a useful IDE tool for editing, testing, and running python.
      <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-the-pycharm-python-ide-in-linux-4091033">Here</a> are
      the steps to install Pycharm. Once it is done, you can clone the DahlgrenTest repository to Pycharm.
    </p>
    <h3>Setting up GEMINI in Qt Creator</h3>
    <h4>Configure Kits</h4>
    <p>It's important to install all the following libraries above especially <code>libqt5websockets5-dev</code> since websockets are used in GEMINI. Upon opening the project (by opnening Gemini.pro), you will be asked of what kits to use and configure. You should include the following kits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Desktop (by default)</li>
      <li>Desktop Qt 5.15.0 GCC 64bit</li>
      <li>Qt 5.15.0 WebAssembly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It may automatically have these kits checked. Note the version of Qt that have been used to test GEMINI is <code>5.15.0</code>.

    <h4>Configure Run Settings</h4>
    <p>GEMINI is run with certain arguments in Qt creator. The command line arguments must be noted in Run Settings. Click on any of the builds on the left side to build GEMINI (Desktop Qt 5.15.0 GCC 64bit has been used the most, so it is much reliable). The following command arguments must be added under the command line arguments in order:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>the path to <code>config.gii</code>in the GEMINI folder on your local machine</li>
      <li><code>gui</code></li>
    </ol>
