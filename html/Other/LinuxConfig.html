    <h3>Installing Virtual Machine</h3>
    <p>Follow these step-by-step <a href="VMSetup.html">instructions</a>
      to install the virtual box to your machine. Stick with the recommendations
      of how much memory to give to the VM depending on how much RAM your machine has.
      For storage at slide 10, you do not have to give 32GB for the virtual hard disk.
      GEMINI tools and software packages doesn't require a bunch of space, so you could
      give as low as 20GB.
