    <h3>Installing GEMINI Tools</h3>
    <h4>QT Creator</h4>
      QT Creator is an IDE for C++, JavaScript, and QML that simplifies GUI
      application development. To install it, follow these instructions:
      <ol>
        <li>Go to QT Open Source <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">website</a> and download
        the QT Online Installer at the bottom of the site. It should detect the correct version you need to download based on what machine you have.
        </li>
        <li>
          The installer should be in your Downloads folder. In order to open it you will have to open up the terminal,
          navigate to the Downloads folder and type <code>chmod 777 qt-unified-linux-x64-3.2.3-online.run</code>.
          Afterwards you should be able to double click and open it.
        </li>
        <li>You will be prompted to make a qt account.</li>
        <li>Once you get to the step where you have to select the components you want to install, make sure you have
          nothing selected except for the Developer and Designer tools. This is to assure it would work initially, and then go back and add
          version 5.15.0. At this point you can also try downloading 5.15.0 and you will likely be fine,
          but if you experience any errors during installation redo the process and download it separately.<br>

        </li>
        <li>After installation, open QT Creator to assure it is working and runs properly.</li>
        <li>Close QT Creator and open the QT folder that was just downloaded onto your machine. In that folder you should
          find an application called MaintenanceTool. Open it, provide your login information and select
          <code>Add or remove components</code>. From there you should be taken back to the screen where you can select the
          components you wish to install. Now you can select Qt 5.15.0 and install it. This will likely take longer
          than the previous installation. Afterwards you should be prompted to open QT creator again and in doing so
          QT should be functional and allow you to view different examples on the welcome screen.<br>

        </li>
      </ol>
      Install the following libraries for operating GEMINI in QT Creator in the terminal:
    <ul>
      <li><code>sudo apt install gcc</code></li>
      <li><code>sudo apt install build-essential</code></li>
      <li><code>sudo apt-get -y install cmake</code></li>
      <li><code>sudo apt install qtbase5-devel</code> (Disregard this library if an error arises.)</li>
      <li><code>sudo apt install g++</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once everything is installed and git is setup, open QT Creator and click on "Open Project", and open "Gemini.pro" that
      is in the GEMINI folder. Stick with the default options after opening it.
      From there you can be able to view the workspace with all the GEMINI files in it.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, linux does not support GitHub desktop, so you have to install git with <code>sudo yum install git</code> in the terminal.
      Afterwards, clone the repository with <code>git clone https://github.com/bsdillon/DahlgrenTest.git</code> in any directory of your choosing.
      I did mine under Documents. To switch to a specific branch, use <code>git checkout 'existing branch'</code>. Use
      "GEMRefactor" for existing branch since all work for updated work on GEMINI is in this branch. Make sure you pull
      from the branch origin every now and then when it gets updated.
    </p>
    <h4>Pycharm</h4>
    <p>Pycharm is a useful IDE tool for editing, testing, and running python.
      <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-the-pycharm-python-ide-in-linux-4091033">Here</a> are
      the steps to install Pycharm. Once it is done, you can clone the DahlgrenTest repository to Pycharm.
