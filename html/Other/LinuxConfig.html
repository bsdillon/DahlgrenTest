    <h3>Installing Virtual Machine</h3>
    <p>Follow these step-by-step <a href="VMSetup.html">instructions</a>
      to install the virtual box to your machine. Stick with the recommendations
      of how much memory to give to the VM depending on how much RAM your machine has.
      For storage at slide 10, you do not have to give 32GB for the virtual hard disk.
      GEMINI tools and software packages doesn't require a bunch of space, so you could
      give around 20 GB.

    <h3>Installing GEMINI Tools</h3>
    <h4>Pycharm</h4>
    <p>Pycharm is a useful IDE tool for editing, testing, and running python.
      <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-the-pycharm-python-ide-in-linux-4091033">Here</a> are
      the steps to install Pycharm. Once it is done, you can clone the DahlgrenTest repository to Pycharm.
    </p>
    <h4>QT Creator</h4>
    <p>QT Creator is an IDE for C++, JavaScript, and QML that simplifies GUI
      application development. You can install this tool with the following yum command: <code>sudo yum install qt-creator</code>.
      Note you need to install these following libraries before being able to create a GEMINI workspace in QT Creator using <code>sudo yum install</code>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>epel-release</code></li>
      <li><code>glibc.i686</code></li>
      <li><code>gcc-c++.x86_64</code></li>
      <li><code>nss-util.i686</code></li>
      <li><code>glibc-devel.i686</code></li>
      <li><code>mesa-libGL-devel.i686</code></li>
      <li><code>qt-devel.i686</code></li>
      <li><code>rpm-build.x86_64</code></li>
      <li><code>libreoffice-writer.x86_64</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once everything is installed and git is setup, open QT Creator and click on "Open Project", and open "Gemini.pro" that
      is in the GEMINI folder. Stick with the default options after opening it.
      From there you can be able to view the workspace with all the GEMINI files in it.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, linux does not support GitHub desktop, so you have to install git with <code>sudo yum install git</code> in the terminal.
      Afterwards, clone the repository with <code>git clone https://github.com/bsdillon/DahlgrenTest.git</code> in any directory of your choosing.
      I did mine under Documents. To switch to a specific branch, use <code>git checkout 'existing branch'</code>. Use
      "GEMRefactor" for existing branch since all work for updated work on GEMINI is in this branch. Make sure you pull
      from the branch origin every now and then when it gets updated.
