    <h3>Downloading the Virtual Machine</h3>
    <p>These instructions will take you through the process of downloading and installing VirtualBox as well as
      setting up your first VM. There are some changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On slide 6, select Ubuntu (64-bit) instead of Red Hat (64-bit).</li>
      <li>On slide 9 I recommend a dynamically allocated disk space. This will allow you to add more space to 
        the existing VM if you need it.</li>
      <li>After slide 11 your VM is done</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting up the virtual machine with Ubuntu</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Ubuntu Desktop from this <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">link</a>. We prefer 
        version 20.04. It's best to save this somewhere safe on your computer and not just leave it in your 
        downloads folder.</li>
      <li>Once it downloads, start the new VM and this Ubuntu image should be automatically selected. If not
        you can browse for it.</li>
      <li>Choose the language. Choose to <em>install Ubuntu</em> rather than a trial version or something without 
        graphics. This may take a while.</li>
    </ol>
