Making progress! Got the python building again. 
Got rid of an unnecessary call(of some sorts to a docker hub push) that probably wasnt doing anything.

Still having the problem with calling pytest and flake8. I am 99% sure that this problem stem from some 
pathing not being correct when creating the docker container. When I figure out how to call pytest from
within the container it should work! The same goes with flake8(the linter). I am pretty sure that that
setting up c++, or any other language should be similar.

I also cleared up some of my confusion on what some of those extra files do, by looking at the flake8 
and pytest  documentation and I will create a doc that details all of my findings, using these notes and
any more knowledge I gain.
