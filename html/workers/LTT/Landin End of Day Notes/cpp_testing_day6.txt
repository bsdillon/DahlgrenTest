FINALLY got the C/C++ complete! It is avaliable to view on this branch! 

There are some problems that I am looking into relating to the different build matrices that are being used in the work flow.
The builds on Mac and Ubuntu are working but the other two are having trouble. I think the Windows build is having some compilation
errors(maybe due to the version of C++ that is being used). The other is having an unknown error in the configure and build phase of 
the action.

It is nice to have a working version, but I will keep with this example because of the errors. 

Here is the link to the workflow that has the successful tests.
