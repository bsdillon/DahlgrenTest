Docker: used to separate the product from the machine it is being run on
allows for any system to pull an image to create a container that will run the program

Use it to install anything that you will need for the program.

Ex.: You are developing python code.
	You do not want to have to instal the python development programs
	you can use docker to install the required dependencies for running the program

How this relates to GitHub actions

We can use actions to install the dependencies and to run the program

we can also install dependencies that will allow us to test that code.
