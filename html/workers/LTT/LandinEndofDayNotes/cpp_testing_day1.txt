So far I have been reading on C++ testing frameworks. 
One that seemed like it could be promising is Catch2 it seems to be maintained and regularly updated.
Another promising one is MSTest, which has a thread on stackoverflow that may help

C/C++ does have a Github preset workflow which will help, but there is some setup file that needs to be investigated.

I have also gone back to the Python-Tests-Second-Try because the way that C++ will have to be 
set up on actions may be similar to that.
