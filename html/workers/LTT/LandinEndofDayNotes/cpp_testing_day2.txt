Spent the day looking for ways to get C/C++ code running on GitHub actions and came across a few good resources.
Tried doign some things that immediatley came to mind, but those didn't pan out.

I have been reading through these links/repositories

A lot is going on in this one, and I think this is probably the best resource! 
I am still trying to wrap my head around what all is going on.

Another one that has a lot going on 
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5265628/Writing-CI-Pipeline-using-GitHub-Actions-to-Build

This one is the simplist but and I was able to fork from this repository which gave the results in the action like we want.
This one also has an example of artifacts.

The forked version which has the actions running
https://github.com/landin3thorsted/HelloWorld
https://github.com/landin3thorsted/HelloWorld/actions/runs/130160215

A lot to read through! I think something should come from one if not multiple of these.
