Docker: used to separate the product from the machine it is being run on
allows for any system to pull an image to create a container that will run the program

Use it to install anything that you will need for the program.

Ex.: You are developing python code.
	You do not want to have to instal the python development programs
	you can use docker to install the required dependencies for running the program

How this relates to GitHub actions

We can use actions to install the dependencies and to run the program

we can also install dependencies that will allow us to test that code.



The tests before were not using docker and were native only to the GitHub actions workspace.
With docker, one could theoretically docker pull the image from DockerHub and build the code without having to install any dependencies.

Using DockerHub you and other people can push and pull images that your setup needs, which saves everyone from having to install everything. 
We are doing something similar to this on GitHub with actions, but I think that actions are just one part of the picture when it comes to Docker. As it stands now we could still have the problem of the program working on GitHub but not a personal machine.

Right now my thoughts are that we can use GitHub and Actions to share and test the code, and we use docker to make sure that we can use a common workspace, that can allow us to build the code on our own machines and not just GitHub.
