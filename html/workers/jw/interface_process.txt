My issue: Create a simple HTML page with a button that returns a value from C++ code when pressed.

First I looked at Google Protocol Buffers
-Code that can be outputted into different languages (Js, C++, etc)
-Can compact packages into smaller packages/binary

Next I looked at Node.js
-Asynchronous, non-blocking Javascript runtime environment
-C++ addons
  -dynamically-linked shared objects written in c/c++
  -provide an interface between javascript and c/c++ libraries
This seemed the most promising so I went with it

I coded a C++ addon that compared the time it took for Javascript and C++ to run the same function, got from an example online
I used the C++ function and binding.gyp file from that example for my own project
Created a simple Node.js server along with those files
Created a module that can be called in the server's script to call the C++ function
Coded the server to display text "The solution to a complicated math problem" + the module/solution to C++ calculation

Created a javascript file to send an XMLHttp request to the Javascript server to alert the text
Created an HTML page with a button and event listener that called the XLMHttp request on click
Surprised myself with actually completing this project!
