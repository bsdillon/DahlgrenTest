    <h3>What is an XMLHttp Request?</h3>
    <p>
      XMLHttprequest is a built-in browser object that allows you to send HTTP requests in JavaScript. 
      Despite having "XML" in its name these requests can work with data in any format. 
      They were specifically named XMLHttprequests because at the time they were made XML was the most common data format.
      <br><br>There is a more moddern format for sending HTTP requests called Fetch, however, XMLHttprequest are still used for several reasons including:<br>
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Historical reasons: To support already existing scripts using XMLHttprequests</li>
        <li>To support older browsers</li>
        <li>To do somethings that Fetch API cannot yet, like tracking upload progress</li>
      </ul><br>
    <h3>How to Make an XMLHttprequest</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Step 1: Create a variable to initiate a new XMLHttprequest</b><br><br>
      &nbsp;<i>var request = new XMLHttpRequest()</i><br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Step 2: Open the request</b><br><br>
      &nbsp;<i>request.open('GET', 'http://localhost:1337/', true)</i><br><br>
      <i>'GET'</i> refers to the operation the request will perform.<br> 
      There are several different "CRUD" operations you can use in your request to manipulate the data on the website/file you are sending the request to, the most popular being:<br>
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>GET - used to grab info</li>
        <li>POST - used to send info</li>
        <li>PUT - used to update info</li>
        <li>DELETE - used to delete info</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      <i>'http://localhost:1337/'</i> refers to the url the request will be sent to.<br> 
      You can set your url to a variable and include that in the request or you can include the url itself.<br><br>
      <i>true</i> refers to whether or not the request will be synchronous or asynchronous.<br> 
      Writing <i>true</i> or leaving that statement blank will set the request to be asynchronous, while writing <i>false</i> will set the request to be synchronous.<br><br>
    </p>
      
    <p>
      <b>Step 3: Set the response method</b><br><br>
      &nbsp;<i>request.onload = function () {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert(request.response);<br>
      &nbsp;}</i><br><br>
      The onload function will run everytime the webpage/file the request is being sent to loads.<br>
      You can display the response however you wish, whether as an alert, in the console, or in a paragraph.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Step 4: Whatever else you want</b><br><br>
      At this point you can also add any other code you would like to execute, whether it be adding more to the onload function, making a new function you want to execute, or anything else.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Step 5: Sending the request</b><br><br>
      &nbsp;<i>request.send()</i><br><br>
      After you have written all of the code you wish to execute with your request all that is left is to write the command to send it.

    <h3>How to set parameters for an XMLHttp request</h3>
    <p>(Sepcifically when making a GET requet to an Express.js server)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up an XMLHttprequest as explained above</li>
      <li>After opening the request, set a request header with a name and value of your choice.</li>
      <li>On the server side, create an if statement that listens for that header and returns something whenever it is recieved.<br><br>
          &nbsp;<i>request.setRequestHeader('name', 'value');</i><br><br>
          &nbsp;<i>if (req.headers.name) {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever you want the server to do in response;<br>
          &nbsp;}</i></li>
    </ol><br>
