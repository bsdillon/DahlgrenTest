DevOps:
Start with code you write and eventually deploy it in the destination server which is designed to run multiple operating system or “minicomputers.” 
Types of “minicomputers”: virtual machines, containers.
Containers:
Containers are a standard unit of software that packages up code and all of its component, so it can run from one computing environment to another that consists of different types of applications. 
Docker:
Most common platform for Containers: Docker
Start with a Docker file that defines your configuration, asks you to download a file and move it to a folder and deploy it. 
Docker image is made from docker file that is all of dependencies and applications into one big group. 
All of this can be utilized in Docker Hub
Run the docker image to create instances of containers
