    <h2>Creating and Handling Pull Requests</h2>
    <p>Make sure you have GitHub desktop downloaded and cloned the repository. If you don't, go to this <a href="../../NewDevelopers/NewDevelopers.html">link</a>.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click on Current Branch dropdown and select "New Branch".</li>
      <li>After you name it, make changes to a file by opneing your repository in a different application. Here I used Atom.

      <li>Make sure the branch is passing the GitHub's validation checks, and if it doesn't, go back to step 3.
