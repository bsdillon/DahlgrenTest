    <h3>What is a Push?</h3>
    <p>A push is when you have changes on your local machine that
      you want to publish back on the GitHub server.
    </p>
    <p>Use:</p>
    <p>Say you are using GitHub Desktop and you have been making
      some changes to code, and are ready to send it to GitHub
      to be reviewed. You would initiate a push that would take
      your local changes and publish them to the server.
