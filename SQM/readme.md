## Windows compile + run commands

```
// Recommended method:
python run.py // for GUI
python run.py [java|cpp] [path/to/src/directory] // for CLI

// Use -h or --help for reminder instructions
python run.py [-h|--help]
```

## Linux compile + run commands
Reference the [linux_container_setup.md](https://github.com/bsdillon/DahlgrenTest/blob/master/SQM/linux_container_setup.md) README for Linux installation and debugging instructions.

```
