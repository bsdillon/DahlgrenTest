12/27/2023 - Starting work on update RFW 3.1
* I added a static version number 3.1 and when a file saves it saves with that number.
  * I also looked for and assumed 3.0 if no version number is in the file.
  * I left an if statement checking for an update and printing a statement that an update is necessary.
  * copied all the 3.0 files I have to verify them later with an update.
  * file verison number - DONE
* The file hierarchy and save new are both dependent on the same feature. I want to be able to open any file and close any file.
  * I found a function for save as and menu items. I meant to enable them but the feature just wasn't ready.
  * So, I have three paths to exportJSON and by the time it comes to export, it already "knows" the right path.
    * Creating a new project
    * Saving the project
    * SaveAs the project
  * Related to this I have to deal with opening a project and importJSON.
    * getProjectName has a reasonable way to do this. Needs adaptation.
  * import/export JSON both just take a file name, so they aren't to blame.
* I worked on the open file first. It already searches for any JSON and I just needed to remove dependencies on config folder and project file name.
  * Now all examples of open require a file name and they are all working.
  * Export already uses a file, so we have no problem there.
  * I think I have this managed now. A bit of clean up. I have also been removing all YETI
  * Tested it and everything works
  * file hierarchy in the same folder as tests - DONE
  * save a version of one file with different name - DONE
* Working to remove the file dependencies WITHIN the json.
  * There is a path and a file name as well as image locations that are all empirical.
  * They need to be relative.
  * I got rid of projPath and only use projFile in dynamic memory. It is no longer saved into the file.
  * no file dependency in the file - DONE
  * Images are saved with raw locations. When they are loaded we append the folder path.
* Need to move on to adding views. First we will create the file structure.
  * I created an dataset viewList which is a dictionary. The name of the view corresponds to an image name and will eventually have widgets.
  * I'm pretty happy that it works as a hierarchy, but I'm not sure b/c we don't have multiple views.
  * What I have planned is that:
    * images and widgets still exist in their own lists. 
    * Views also exist in a dictionary. 
    * The views will know which widgets they have
    * widgets will know which views define them and contain them.
  * To test this I also need to add more views.

12/28/2023 Okay, working on views
* Do I need to be able to select the views and add them from the image window.
* OR can the main window manage views and the image window remains much as it is.
* Think it would be SIMPLER to not change the image window. 
* I will have to coordinate the views as a new menu
* Found a bug in the file dependency stuff. the first view image was saved with a full file path.
  * fixed that; now all files load small (i.e. without full path) but are saved large in dynamic memory and then saved smalla again.
* also worked on a pop up to select among the views. Still needs work
  * Trying to get that shaped and centered, etc.
  * Okay, it is centered and the right size, but not really modal. Good enough.
* add views - Done
* I set up functions to update views and delete views. I'm tying it into the imagewindow and I'm testing now.
  * edit/update images for views - DONE
  * delete views - DONE
  * select views - DONE
  * I tested everything thoroughly and I can create new views and update olds or delete them. The images in the other window all update appropriately.
  * Realized that I had to save the data to the json and import it again. That second action automatically updates the images. Oh well. Some wasted effort.
* Alright, now I'm working on defining a widget on a VIEW rather than a window.
  * Looking around in Imagewindow, I didn't even have it on my list, but I was able to fix the overlap issue.
  * Basically commented out two checks and associated methods for overlap checks.
    * Still not sure how the click is going to work in those overlap areas
    * Remove overlap errors - DONE
  * I created a currentView value which is updated periodically in imagewindow
  * mainWindow can get that value from imagewindow as necessary
* starting to fiddle with widget. 
  * removing the YETI stuff
  * I made a widget have a view which is populated when it is first created
  * It saves fine
* I realize that the image list is completely redundant. 
  * Need to get rid of it in favor of Views
  * Actually, most of it is irrelevant or redudant in the current code.
  * Okay, I'm getting widgets to load on the first view, but I need to clear them out when we select a new view
  * window-view-widget - Done

12/29/2023 Starting again.
* Okay, first order of business is changing the widgets on the imagewindow depending on the view
  * First, mainwindow calls imagewindow.updateImage to setup or alter a widget overlay
    * Every time it does, the preceding widget/overlay is DELETED
    * imageWindow.deleteOverlays is callable to remove any specific widget
    * imageWindow.changeSelectedImage is the result of the view change in imagewindow
      * Creating an event from imagewindow to mainwindow
      * Extracted a method to update all widgets on the current view from importJSON.
      * Reusing that code for the event handler.
      * There is no general delete of all widgets, so I kept track of views and delete them at the same time I add others.
      * Ready. Time to test
        * Oops. widget_list was already updated with newTableEntry
    * It's all working. I can remove any widget from the list and I can see all the widgets ont he right screen.
* I'm going to start importing widgets.
  * I have vague plans that the widgets will know the view they belong to and the views will know ALL the widgets that exist on the view
  * I revised the menu bar in imageWindow to include a button for the import
    * Reusing the choice popup
  * Okay, I can import a widget, but it is still treated like a regular widget
  * I'm happy with the color and look of imported widgets
  * I've added the import to the JSON. Should be able to save and recall.
  * Tested it all. Works fine.
  * import widgets - DONE
  * select imported widgets - DONE
  * common anchors - DONE
* The next issue is that multiple imported widgets should be locked together.
  * consider that if we import a set of widgets from View X we should have -*
  * editing locations takes place in Widget.
    * Introduced "isForiegn" and disabled everything but x and y location in a widget.
  * created WidgetEditor.viewUpdate which is a tuple tracking the latest update for a foreign widget
  * now I'm storing the dx,dy for all foreign widgets in view X all as part of each view.
  * I set up a function that takes all the affected widgets and uses the widget->dict->widget path to edit the copy we give the imagewindow.
  * I'm not 100% sure I have found all the pathways
  * testing
    * I have a problem with image coordination. 
      * The editor is pulling the image from the currentview
      * THe list get's the same image. I need it to stay where it is.
    * Still not working. Need a break
      * When the widgets load they are getting the right pictures.
      * When I edit the imported widget it starts with the wrong image (from the original image)
        * But once I adjust the location, it goes back to the right image.
      * I fixes the first image for editing
        * still updating with the right image
      * The image in the table is still right, but it's changing the cropping.
        * I simply prevent any update for a foreign export
* There was a bug in the imported widgets. they aren't being removed.
  * I had to maintain the object for widgets. Can't go to dictionary and back or I lose overlays.
  * First, I see there is a confusion between tkImages and images. I can't use one for the other.

1/2/2024 Welcome to the new year. Working on this image thing.
* I need to rethink names of all variables and methods to make it clearer what they are.
  * I worked out that two methods had duplicate code for images. I extracted a method and decreased the scope of each.
  * I made sure that tkImage is used for images of that type, but left image in as few places as possible
  * Found another two methods. Just too much similarity
* Okay, I have cleaned this up as much as I can without more dedicated effort. 
  * Some of the extra parameters I suggested are really of no interest.
  * Testing again
    * Overstated the case. One of those abandoned parameters actually mattered.
    * I can see why things didn't always work. 
      * Most of the uses of widget.image were for ImageTk, 
      * At least one needed a save function which ONLY exists in Image
    * Something about the save file process is not keeping all the widgets on each view. Not even the native ones.
      * Fixed that, but I'm only seeing the LAST of the imported overlays showing up
    * I got the images to move together!!!
* Just cause it was pissing me off, I removed all the YETI
  * removing all YETI - DONE
* Still testing the image stuff. things move, but they don't get saved.
  * I had imperfectly added something to the list; now the view is updated
  * all should move as one to keep them in the same locations - DONE
* There also appear to have been multiple of the same widget added to a list. 
  * I fixed the file and hope I won't see that again.
* Need to prevent views from being imported/selected/etc when not in use.
  * That was quick
  * enable/disable views when a window is loaded/unloaded - DONE
* Next I need to prevent multiple imports of the same widget.
  * First, let me try to create duplicate names by importing the same thing twice
  * Okay, lots of duplicate names and not only where I imported twice.
  * Let's just try opening and saving to see what happens.
  * Still happening, just from opening the file.
    * I noticed that the only duplicates were not imports.
    * Took me a while to track down that using newTableEntry was adding the name to the viewlist in addition to the table.
    * I changed the call to just updateTableRow. That fixed the duplication.
  * Along the way I made the same change for view names. Don't give a same name to the views.
  * Okay, still looking for all the places where widgets are added
  * I think I've prevented them from being added, but now NOTHING is on the imagewindow.
  * Finally got that working again. I think we can limit the list of AVAILABLE imports.
  * Testing shows that it works.
  * prevent importing the same image twice - DONE

Time to reassess requirements; The next group will deal with widgets.
* Let's start with an easy one. Radio buttons and tabs already have groups
* Went back to the widget types and added new fields for 
  * links (buttons and tabs)
  * checked/unchecked images

1/7/2024 Working on complex widgets.
* Going back to the new checkbox/radio image selection

1/8/2024 I've been naughty because I haven't been taking notes
* I got the image to come up and I got buttons to move an overlay
* All those events are working now. 
* I'm just having a bit of trouble getting the overlay to sit in the right place
  * As an example, the root image (imported for the purpose of finding the checkbox) is 422x359 confirmed in paint
  * The area of the widget is 35x31
  * I start by centralizing the location and I get (422-35)/2 =  193   (359-31)/2 = 164 (193,164) 
  * That position shows as ALL the way bottom right????
  * approximate center of the image is shown as (98,79)????
  * I can also confirm that the movement is twice the number of pixels. 
    * For example sthis is roughly 20x20 and when I move 5 pixels twice I am 20 pixels moved
  I also added boundary checking and while it stops at zero, it doesn't recognize the right and lower edges thinking they are 422 and 359.
    * So, everything is DOUBLE what it should be
* I figured out my mistake. I had been locating the image overlay at x,y and the moving it by delta_x and delta_y. I thought those were moving it TO x and y.
  that's why it was double.
* Okay, I've worked out selecting the image location, saving the image, but there is a slight offset
  * The w/h seems to be right, but the x/y is up by half w/h so it only captures the south east corner of the image
  * By moving the overlay I can tell that (0,0) is actually halfway NW of the origin. Why?
  * I showed this to stacey and she just said move it by 1/2 shape size. 
  * That works, but it isn't right, but I left a TODO to fix that.
* I have got most of it working, but now I have to make sure the image updates when dimensions change.
  * I have it all done, but it needs serious testing.

1/9/2024 Back at it.
* Trying to auto-update checkbox icon with changes in the widget size
* I found out that the width and height of widget was not being updated until the editor closed.
  * That fixed the problem.
* I added an error to notify the user if the selected image is smaller than the dimensions of the proposed widget.

1/10/2024 Okay, retesting the capability for checkbox and radio button.
* I've been messing about with various bugs. Little things that need to be straightened out.
* I need a better file system for the checkbox images
  * I can't use anything that will conflict between the two check/uncheck.
  * I need a name for the widget, which doesn't always exist.
    * I had to manage the name of the widget and enable/disable the checkboxes
  * I can't figure out why the checked images are loading when the widget comes up.
    * Forgot to save the tkImage again....
  * We have a problem with a widget being treated as foreign because we are on a different view.
* Okay, I'm pretty happy that this has been all tested and resolved.
  * checked/uncheck images - DONE
* I setup the multi-add/delete import widgets and had to resolve some bugs there.
  * sometimes imports got deleted inadvertantly.
  * ran into that while messing with the next objective.
* I created the link drop down for buttons and tabs
  * Adding <None> as an option for links
  * Earlier I removed the list of yeti objects, but now I removed the other list too.
    * we can use the keys (i.e. names of widgets) from the list of value types
  * any button/tab links to a view - DONE
* Starting work on complex widgets.
  * We need to define groups, but how do those groups work on the screen
  * I'd like to do something to identify them visually.
  * I added a color system with several pre-defined colors
  * The group colors are working, but I've got 
* name changes cause overlay to stop appearing
  * got that fixed
* editing a foreign widget should not make it appear on the present view.

1/16/2024 ONce more to the fray.
* I have to go back to the errors seen last time.
  * I set up a block on foreign widgets, but that section is not being hit. Something else is at work.
  * Okay, I forced a stack trace and found the path that was breaking.
  * I can't just block the path because it is used for NEW widgets.
  * I added a check for overlays that refers back to the master window.
    * Unfortunately, the widget isn't added to the view until AFTER the overlay is added. So it doesn't work for new widgets.
    * is the pathway altogether wrong?
    * I fixed it by having the table update check and then update overlays. No one else does that.
    * Similar issue for imports.
    * It all works now.
* Alright. At this point we have "complex" widgets in that certain things belong to a group.
  * To support all the complex widget types, I need to implement a few more widget types.
  * complex widgets - DONE
* I have prepared a set of slides on what else is required.
  * I altered the list of widgets now so we can have scroll buttons.
  * I added direction as a value of scroll buttons
  * I made lists have a group (they cannot exist by themselves becasue they will have scroll buttons)
  * Do I still need labels?
  * With all the new widgets
* Fixing some bugs with the choice popup
* So, with the all the new wi+dgets, we still have to deal with legacy widgets.
  * Scroll Bar and Drop down
  * there was no support for either of these in 3.0, but YETI definitely allowed it.
  * I will need to arrange legacy support
  * lists - DONE
  * drop downs - DONE
  * radio ValueButtons - DONE

1/25/2024 9 days later...
Okay, let's get this save menu thing fixed and out of the way. It's a bug on my list that needs resolution.
* I wanted to handle it with enables/disables of menu items, but that doens't seem to be working.
* I found the problem. I added all the menus to filemenu and then I REUSED filemenu as an identifier for a new menu.
* Now all the menus disable and I even did the opposite enabling for new and open as they shouldn't be pressed when a project is already open.
  * disable save menus better - DONE
* I'm testing the whole operation with a notepad application
  * Fixed an enable/disable mapping
  * Corrected the return from multi-widget import
  * I need to add a scrollbar to the main window list.
    * got that fixed
  * When we reload the checkbox image, it would help if we located the square in the right space...now it always shows up in the middle.
    * got that fixed
  * checkbox images aren't loading in the widget editor
    * Oh. Apparently I didn't get them saved earlier. Now it's working.
  * somehow we still aren't showing n  ative widgets on secondary views
    * Fixed that.
* I intentionally made format menu offset by a bunch to give those imports something to do.
* I'm happy with it. It looks like it does everything I wanted it to. Time to move on to the next one.

1/26/2024 Working on building the working RFW environment

1/29/2024 - Working on the environment again
* I'm rewriting the documentation to make it build a little, test a little
* I've run into more serious bugs in the RFGUIHelper.
  * I have corrupted the save file, so I'm going to create a file validation process.
    * I have it clearing out anything that doesn't make sense. That's not a great way to fix it, but it's something.
  * We have a problem saving and closing when there is an open widget. There should only be one and it should be on top.
    * I went back and refactored, moving the widget editor stuff all into main window. 
    * One process now that covers everything.
    * Still not sure this fixes everything.

2/2/2024 - Okay. I have to deal with some of these bugs still.
* It took a while to route everything, but I finally have it blocking when a widget is open. But it isn't LIFTING the window up.
  * I found a way to make it permanently on top regardless. That works.
* I THINK these bugs were fixed
  * window didn't save. maybe because there was an open widget.
  * window didn't close. maybe because there was an open widget.
* Bug - when a view is added, all widgets appear in red on it.
  * Actually, there are two problems.
    * Old overlays are not removed before views are updated.
    * Only the overlays from the first view are added.
    * Confirmed that blue and red both appear---if they are on the first view
  * Hmm. Maybe I want to block more operations by a widget.
    * I fiddled with the action menu and made it appear in the same space as the view changes.
    * I created a reloadProject function for all the times when a project is saved and then reopened. I intend that should fix these bugs.
    * It has to close the existing project and clear overlays
      * Does it even run when a project is open?
        * self.projFile needs to be saved between save and open.
        * I have a catch-22 moment. I want to validate views against widgets and widgets against views. But one MUST come first.
        * I separated the GUI update and put it AFTER the validation steps.
        * I had to improve the enabling menus feature.
        * I'd like the old tester to give it's location to the new tester
        * Okay. That looks fine.
      * Does it close any open widget editor? Should it recreate them?
        * This is now OBE.  Can't do anything when a widget is open. :)

2/6/2024 - Working again
* I  had an epiphany. I think I should use RFW to test RFW. At least whenever I get up from the chair.
* I find a bug just from testing that.
* Found another bug from this. Still haven't create a real test, just using the tool.
* Oh my gosh. Another one. This has been all over the place.
* Twice now I have renamed windows to give them individual titles. This is EXCLUSIVELY for the testing process. More evidence of coding for test and use.
* I am still seeing the red overlays from the first view when I add a new view. Still need to remove them.
  * I think that at some point I was adding overlays to the imagewindow as an attribute, but I stopped doing that.
  * had to find where the overlays were supposed to be deleted and make sure they could be found. Then I tied it into closing a project. That did it.
* I went back to the configuration instructions and spent a lot of time updating images based on this test capability.
* I put instructions in for the python path so that it was part of the configuration instructions.
  * This resolves most of the file path issues I had with previous code. OQE library and widget library couldn't be found, etc.
  * I'm in a bit of catch 22 because the current generic window can't actually use the 3.1 config files. So, I need to work on that.

2/8/2024 - On again
* I built the oqeTest which generates the test messages proving everything is connected.
* Updated the documentation to use that test.
* Working on First test of RFGUIHelper with GUI tools.
* I am revising the way a file is parsed
  * Created a new View object
  * Moving all widget-work to the view
    * a couple of window keywords are delegated to views
  * Slowly separating the two and figuring out what fits best where.
  * Significant revision of widget creation. Will have impact on several files, not to mention new files

2/14/2024 - happy valentines days
* Added classes for List, label, and scrollbutton.
* Depricated scrollbar
* Started cleaning up standard widget methods in parent class
  * Identified click and capture as universal actions for all widgets
  * Routing these actions from window to current view
  * I was able to remove all the cases where description was used instead of location. Really that shouldn't be required.
  * Adding parameter hints to all functions
  * Window and Widget are done. Starting on View
  
2/16/2024 - One more time
* Finishing the foreign widget stuff
* Somehow I have created a circular reference in the imports, but I also have changed those imports....
  * Why is robot insisting there is code I have changed?
  * I was running code from a different directory....
* Well that was stupid. I was trying to combine the updated code and I somehow OVERWROTE my window.py which is the class that had the most changes....
* I'm going back over all the fixes I put in.
  * This is going much faster now that I know what the code is supposed to do.
  * After just three hours, I think I'm where I was before. Maybe not identical, but comparable.
* That was my first successful find and debug gui with the new views. Further ahead than I thought I would be!
* Back to updating documentation.

2/23/2024 - Back to the fray!
* I started documenting again and realized that the red/green blocks weren't appearing. I remembered that it needed a '--'
  * That needs to change. I was looking for another character I can use for the purpose. We have --, ==, **, ??? I need something else.
  * I settled for '&&'
* I think I've finished the 5th test/validation and documention. Just gathering the files.
* I took a break, but now I've got 2.6 hours left.
* I've started on the next section on resource files.
* Working my way through resource files using the various views. I have added two new keywords to Window
  * Expected View
  * Actual View
* Small bug in the revisions to demogui.js. In one place where I dealt with the '--'==(Case xor Step) I had an or.
  * Fixed it.
* Had to add a funciton pointer for linking. Window just takes the new name of a view
* I can click on a button that opens another view.
  * I realized that each view needs a unique anchor; something to find on JUST that view.
  * Can I share anchors? Should I share anchors? Maybe I just want to find on local anchors and you can't verify otherwise?
  * Okay, I've thought a bit and achors CANNOT be shared. Each anchor should be unique to ONLY that one view and with good reason.
    * If the window can find ANY anchor it should be ONLY one view that is possible.
* I was still looking for RFW files in the wrong place. Going back to that secondary location when I should be in my github folder.
* I ran into a bug derived from the way we were creating images for sikuli to read. It was appending .\filename but that only worked for relative paths.
  * Deleted that and now the stuff works.
* Okay, I can click on a file menu, see the new anchors, and then click the close button.

2/27/2024 - Working again for two days in a row.
* Dealing with a couple existing bugs in RFGUIHelper.
  * trying to solve view delete. 
    * was returning single value... but as a list. fixed that
    * didn't load the tkImage for a widget when importing the file. fixed that.
    * View delete menu should really say "delete view". Fixed that.
    * cannot add new views - OBE, probably related to delete
    * Ran into a field out of range issue for imported widgets.
      * Created a new kind of exception that covered the case
      * Auto-closed any edited widget with this kind of problem
      * On a broader scale, how do we want to locate imported widgets that may not fit (entirely) on the view?
      * I gave the value checking a parameter to validate or not and for foreign widgets the validation is NOT used.
        * This will allow foreign widgets to partially overlap or even be outside the view but relative to its achor.
    * I had to create a "crash version" of the window from widgeteditor because we need to track the cancellation of the event.
* Ready to document the capability.
  * For some reason, the anchor from fMenu is not working. I don't have this problemw with aMenu, but can't do it with fMenu
    * Okay, it IS finding it, but only with 89%. Because it didn't find it, that raises and exception.
    * It was a sleep issue! The menu didn't open quickly enough and that why it couldn't find it. SOOOOO much time wasted.
      * On one hand, there is a way to deal with sleep and wait in the documentation.
    * I had to fix several bugs related to how the tools worked at the RFW level and at the GUI level.
  * I went through the process of testing and building report OQE into the a test for menus

2/28/2024
* Back to building the test and documenting.
  * I'm going to work in both the IF-ELSE-END logic and something about the way wait/sleep is supposed to be used.
  * Acutally it was Run Keyword And Expect Error and sleep.
  * Documented everything
  * Added RFW6.robot, RFW6.resource, and updated project4.zip with the current configuration files.
* I briefly edited the remote connection capability. 
  * I think that concludes the documentation update. Unless one of the new features needs validation.

3/5/2024 - Working on more testing.
* I have been building the test up around opening and closing a project
* Had to remove the NotImplemented for a text field to write -- duh!
* Worked to type with an enter; use \n at the end of the text to get a return
* We will need a second "window" because the visible anchor on each side must be independent.
* I had to rethink the move feature because I left in a not implemented error
* Originally, we re-calculated all the offsets, but I think a find is the best way to manage that.

3/21/2024 - Been a hot minute - 
* So, I'm going to start by looking at the way view updates locations.
* Okay, I ran the data and the update locations worked PERFECTLY. Can't see anything being out of place there.
  * I even showed that the predicted locations EXACTLY align with the locations.
* Found it. The view_capture used base.X and base.Y. Oops.
* There was a problem with some images when the wrong view as expected. Not a big deal and perhaps not worth the time I spent on it.
* Going back to make more test cases.

3/22/2024 - DIdn't do much yesterday; just 2 hours, but I have to make up 14 for these two days.
* I'm reconfiguring the resource file and JSONs so that I have three "windows". 
  + The main window will JUST be the main window.
  + The image window will JUST be the image window.
  + Any auxiliary window will be in the third group.
* Fixing the open project function to use the auxliary windows
  + Decided to have all primary/secondary/auxiliary functions reference the same name RF GUI Helper.
* I have a problem with the way it "looks" for the open/closed project. If the main window is not in focus, it looks like the project menu is inactive (i.e. no project)
  * I changed it to look for the image window but that also generates an error.
* I got the whole test to run through without a hitch. Amazing.
* I created a set of tests to add, update, and delete a view
  * added a menu item to rename a view, need to fill in the code.
  * Last set of the delete test isn't working.

3/25/2024 - Working the test again.
* I thought it wasn't finding the delete window, but instead I had the wrong name for the ok button. :/
  * Test now runs fine. Need to plug in the new test to edit names.
* I created the new function. Tested it.
* Added a new test case for it.
  * Decided to change my save progress indicator. I was creating 4 different views, when one would do.
  * Testing it.
  * Worked great.
* New test for all widgets
  * Created an image for the purposes of the test
  * Started running through it manually. Probably need to restart.
* I condensed the vairous open-file operations into one keyword reused everywhere
  * Reran the last test... like a dream. One small change and it all worked.
* I condensed the function for finding a window so it covered all three
  * I had some trouble with the parameters, but once I got it through the automated tests... gold
* I have been working on adding widgets. Some of this is easy, but my widget editor is too...uncertain. 
  * I need to make it fixed in most of its components.

4/1/2024 Back at it again.
* Going to start with a redesign of the widget editor GUI.
  * Need to make the image a fixed size.
  * Adding all the members along the right hand side.
  * Use the existing code to fill/read and enable.
  * I had a problem where some widgets were not being put in correctly. 
    + I was using the same variable name for each of these "throwaway" objects.
    + I don't know why but changing the name fixed it.
  
4/3/2024 
* Back to changing the GUI
* I started by moving all the non-volatile bits to the left and everything volatile to the right
* I now have a different label color that shows if the item has been enabled/disabled at present.
  * Works for native and foreign widgets. Looks like we are back in business.
* Widget Editor needs to have a fixed size that doesn't change. - DONE
* Can we just put all the components on and disable them if not required? - DONE
* We need a standard size widget image in the editor
* Reviewing my code, 
  * instance.tkImage is the name of the actual image saved off in real dimensions
  * instance.tkLabel is the label where the image resides
  * instance.imageSmall is the control on how small/large the image is
  * imageSizeToggle is the function that toggles imageSmall and calls updateTkImage
  * updateTkImage is the function where the image/size is actually changed
* First question: what is the max size we can allow?
  * Eventually, I just moved the size thing out of the way and forced a fixed size.
* The size of the widget editor doesn't adjust for very tall or wide widgets. - DONE
* We need to have widgets as a transaction AND we need to filter for unique names.
* Reviewing my code
  * We are receiving a Widget object and using that object everywhere. So if we change something in that widget... it is permanent.
* So I have gone back and used the to/from dictionary functions on widget to divorce the widget we start from (if in fact we have one) from the one we create at the end.
* Now I can go back and review the results with a filter.
* I'm looking at each place where EditorState.COMPLETE a complete widget add/upate took place.
  * Delete and cancel have no widget answer and they don't matter.
  * One of them just creates a new table entry             self.newTableEntry(self.currentView, self.lastEdited.answer)
    * That only happens once
  * There are TWO other places. One which ALWAYS happens and one which ONLY happens on an Edit.
    * For an edit, either you are looking at a foreign widget and need to update the deltas OR
    * You have to update the existing row in the table.
    * For the always, you need to move images and deal with names BUT THIS IS TOO LATE!!!
* I decided that I need to add a name filter capability while still editing the widget.
* Do we have overlapping names for widgets - DONE
* Image on widget editor needs the aspect ratio of the image within the fixed size - DONE
* Now when I change type I lose any data I have in the widget. - DONE
* I cannot disable the View. - DONE
* The delete button ont widget editor doesn't need to be visible except on edit.

4/8/2024 - Happy eclipse day. Weird that I'm using VS Code. 
* I need to finish cleaning things out and getting the widget test up and running.
* Hmm. I have another bug from the work I just did. Blank link is not allowed.
* Got the blank line fixed.
* Another bug. For some reason I was getting an empty, blank widget on the second run.
  * I was pulling out the list of widget attributes when i should have used a copy.
  * In the process of debugging I added a unique ID for Widgets, which will be helpful in the future. I left it.
* The delete button NEEDS to be present, otherwise we have a change in the layout. Must disable it.
  * Got that solved.
* If you cancel a widget edit, it still takes the new values. ooops. - I THINK this one is OBE
* Do we want to edit view names? - OBE. I already added that feature.
* adding a view with the same name still says saving and apparently creates a new file
  * Fixed this for add. There was a problem with the loop invariant being used for data.
  * Extracted the method and used the same code for view edit and view add name selection.
  * DONE
* When you create an anchor it doesn't create an image. But it does when you edit the widget
  * This is a weird one to reproduce.
  * There is definitely something wrong about the way anchor images are created.
  * There is only one place where a png extension is put on a file: mainwindow.universalWidgetHandler
    * that means that the image name would be created at that time.
    * There is also a mismatch on the 'Image file name' vs 'Image' issue.
    * I think I'll just fix all of it at once.
    * We do NOT want to create a saved image until we save.
    * We want the name of the anchor to dictate the image name
    * Related to this, we need to have at least one anchor per view.
    * "Image file name" needs to be removed, not just replaced with "Image".
    * should I force you to define at least one anchor per view? I need to prevent the anchors from being imported.
* Okay, so first thing is I need to remove Image and Image file name. EVERYWHERE.
  * The file name creation in universalWidgetHandler may not be needed at all.
    * Removing that, eliminates everything else in the complete for that function.
    * Removed all that complete stuff there, which simplifies the problem. 
    * If you are editing, there is a complete hanlder IN YOUR FUNCTION
    * If you are creating a new, same thing in your function.
  * No more Image in widgets. Not anchor. Not movepoint.
  * No more Image widgets on the widget editor.
  * I need to create the images when the file saves
  * I fixed the export save.
    * Created two new functions to get the image for a widget (anchor), and the name of a widget (anchor)
  * Working on load issue...I don't think it needs the image anymore. There is no need to load the image.
  * I think I got it working, but now my name filter seems to be blocking updates on a widget update.
    * I think I have that fixed, but the red overlays aren't happening now.

4/14/2024 - Working with an AI.
* The AI and I are chasing down the bug where overlays remain on the screen unnecessarily.
* Along the way it has suggested a warn/info/debug schema which I want to implement anyway.
  * Added a lot of debug/info statements to trace my error.
  * Mostly start/end of functions
* I have been examining the way widgets are added/updated. There appear to be two paths.
  * 'bsdAnchor' is added to the list of widgets; the other two are not. Why?
* I have been adding a lot more. Learning how the start process works. Still seeing weird stuff.
  * I had to create a new class to own the logging configuration.
  * More fine-tuning of that class, but the AI was able to provide really good examples.
  * Chat GPT is less argumentative.
  * This is actually giving me sample code that I can immediately implement. Better than stack overflow
* The view update error with unknown red overlays STILL happens, but now I have enough data to see why.

4/17/2024 Starting again
* I had another minor problem with the logger. 
  * THe AI actually suggested the right code to fix it, but one of its three suggestions was wrong. Still, that was very quick.
  * I also noted that the line numbers were off because they were coming from the LogManagement, not the calling class.
  * And I needed a multiton to ensure just one logger per class name. I was getting duplicate lines on the second creation of ImageWindow.
I tried Ingrid in Mistral
  * I'm of two minds about Ingrid. She did a great job suggesting code, but she can't follow the rules and doesn't suggest useful debugging steps.
* I tried Benjamín in the Chat GPT.
  * I divided him into Bueno and Malo, but they don't seem to have distinct viewpoints.
  * He isn't able to track the problem from log statement to log statement. If I wasn't very certain about the bug, he would be confusing me.
* I am finally able to address the bug. The problem is that I tried to update the view but I did it in a way that was hinky.
  * I updated self.currentView BEFORE I depended on the pre-change value. Needed to remove that.
  * The change of view usually starts from ImageWindow, but I was trying to call the logic function, but that didn't happen.
    * I need to figure out how to do that. 
    * I got the AI to fill in several blanks. Quite well in fact.
* That is the end of that bug!!!!
* Should we add bug/warn/info/debug filters to logging from widgets? - DONE
* I still saw overlays show up when I added a view, but then then disappeared when i went back to the main view. Not sure if I can even recreate it. - DONE
  * I'm going to call this OBE based on the work I've been doing.
* had a mislabeled widget. I could still get it on the widget import menu even after change. I didn't save the change, but the name was fixed. - DONE
  * Same
* I opened a widget and the link was right. Clicked update. Didn't change a thing. Might be because the name was from and older window.
  * Same
* When you delete a view,  it doesn't get rid of all images. - DONE
* ImageWindow.deleteOverlays is sometimes faced with an "no attribute 'overlay'" which causes big errors. - DONE
  * I changed things so that overlays are a property of ImageWindow and not the widget itself.
* I'm not sure that widget should have overays as an attribute in imagewindow. The way we are no longer holding widgets as objects makes that a problem waiting to happen.
  * Related to last
* Okay. Not too many things left.
* I tried sharing the widget code with the AI and it just isn't getting it. Thinks I have to create new classes that aren't necessary.
  * It suggested a "new" method which was EXACTLY what I had already.
* I had a TODO in my code to handle deleted names of things. Took care of that.
* I had to fix the log level which wasn't blocking lower levels and I had the help of the AI in finding my error. Again, mostly showing example code.
* Added a logging feature to adjust the log level for one class at a time. I'd love to set up a tag-based system at some point.
* The bug was derived from an if/else branch that deleted an existing overlay, but never updated the size of the image. Problems because it was saved in the self.variables.
  * Do we want to define the size of a checkbox image - DONE
* CHeckbox image size is loading as MUCH bigger than it should be. - DONE
  * Now a fixed (stretched) image
* DO we still need createcrash? - OBE
  * At this point, we still need the createcrash for the time being.
* No more bugs on my list. I have decided to do a final review with the AI.
  * I am dividing the AI into different personalities.
  * I covered security, style, cleanliness, etc.
* I immediately started learning new things.
  * Security suggested things that made the popups modal. I have never understood that on python, so this was a good chance to improve my skills.
  * Seguido is not finding anything of interest.

4/18/2024 At it again
* Starting with the multiple personalities again.
* I mentioned "personalities" and it gave me some WILD stuff.
* I noticed that the AI agrees with me... even when it doesn't logically make sense.
* The AI completely missed a logical fallacy where X is set to false and used in an if(X) ... else block.
* I finally got through all the files and cleaned it all up.
* I finished cleaning the last of the code with help from the AI.
----
* Stopped working with RFW for a second. Working instead on an agent tied to chat GPT.
* First problem: how to send/receive messages.
* I found lots of options, but none free. Just need to look around more.

4/21
* Working on AI package.
* I found the llama instructions to maintain context.
* I finally got it talking to me.
* I tried adding rules for radio etiqute but I couldn't get them to follow it, plus the speech was too slow.
  * There are multiple AIs in this chat and we are using audio to communicate. We will use radio etticut to make it clear who is speaking.
    * Start with "Brian this is <YOUR NAME>."
    * State your response.
    * End with "<YOUR NAME> out"
* I got multiple agents working. They can talk to me and see the code files, but I'm not sure the context is working correctly.  

April 24, 2024 - Returning to the RFW testing.
* I explained to the AI what we are working on and it suggested a method. I need to supply the exact coordinates.
* Some bugs related to renaming functions after all my clean up.

April 26, 2024 - Trying once more.
* Still building the test
* Had to redo the images for the test.
* Many minor defects in the tool because of how I "cleaned" it.
* For some reason widgeteditor is crashing when something is out of bounds. ???
  * I found that just showing a error box was crashing the GUI. So, no more errors. Just adjust it.
* I finished building the GUI, but I'm still not sure it's working.
* I think I need to get in the mode of using the tests I've built.
  * No more big refactors.
* AUUUUUUUUUGGG! - Because I removed the image_paths for anchors and movepoints it no longer has a name for the anchors.  

April 29, 2024 - Going back to that bug.
* Well, I finally got that working again. Running through the tests to see if they work.
* SOmehow I changed the procedure for adding views. Need to fix that in the test.
  * I think it was just an order change, not something more fundamental.
* Small bug in RFGUIHelper. Needed a return statement after an error state.
* Another small bug. Didn't proporly convert from error message to exception.
* Another small bug. Didn't give a parent window to an error message
* My test was using the title bar and that had an unfocused version. I changed the anchor to something that always looked the same.
* Okay both previous tests run now.
* In part I've got the new test running. I had to put in a keyword to click << < > >> to adjust numbers, but it isn't working every time.
  * I have had the text 17 read as 'W' and the value 20 read as '20,'. Predictably fails.
* I have tried improving the readable space, just calculating the numbers, and finally doing without adjustments. It just keeps failing.

May 1, 2024
* I've been working on fixing the test again for 90 minutes and I am now DONE.
* I have created OQE keywords for making a promise and it returns a key for the analysis tool to use in the response.
* I have create a small tool to update the json. I have create a small application that is a stand in for third party applications.
  * For some reason I can't see the third party app.
  * I got it to add data and even output a log related to the call.
  * Data is updating after an intentional 5 second delay
* I noticed that I can't put more than one line of HTML in that space. So I have to format everything as HTML I guess.
* Data promising - DONE
* WOrking on the gif-maker. I have inserted the code to take the pictures and testing it now. 
  * For some reason it's not getting the name of the file.
  * I got that all working and now I'm trying to make the watchers function.
    * Having problems with the test not running
    * I fiddled with the method for finding a window and things are broken. Crap.

5/8/2024 - Need to finish this off.
* Working on the PDF generation. So I started by talking with the AI.
* The AI and I have been working on reading the various JSONs
* Working on building the PDF
* Got that working. Integrated links, tables, images, etc. Now working on some boilerplate text for the test report.
* I got hung up trying to break the text into a maximum length. It needs to be adjusted for non-word strings of extreme length.

5/10/2024 - Have to finish cleaning up the PDF maker
* I had to align the style lines with the report. I was one off on some of these.
* I seperated All-report style from, header-only style, and then line-specific style. Now everything is aligned.
* I went back to the report and decided not to include the full file name in the "step" in one case. It's just not necessary.
* Lots of minor issues
  + Reformat the time
  + restrict the column width
  + rebuild the main table with pass/fail blocks
  + resize all images to best show the contents.
* Much happier with that now.
* PDF reporting - DONE

May 16, 2024 - I was just sick for several days.
* Along the way I tried to fix all the linux/windows issues. At this point we have two areas I'm aware of.
  + In RFGUIHelper there is a library needed for windows to us tkinter
    - that is wrapped up in a platform-specific section
  + The file name construction in Window.parseFile depends on the Oops
    - Not anymore. Now the file comes directly from the Test.
    - We do split and rejoin the file name components, but now we use os.join and such.
* fix linux issues - DONE
* Next thing is file revision. I need to make sure 3.0 converts to 3.1.
* I saved off several files and now I need to go compare them.
* I'm working with the AI to generate the method.
* It's a thing of beauty. Works seemlessly and builds the new file in the same place.
* File revision - DONE
* All notimplemented errors should indicate which class and function for debugging purposes
  + Done
* ImageSelection should be on top of WidgetEditor
  + Done. Thank you AI. I couldn't figure it out and it gave me an answer.
* Need gross-size alteration buttons on imageselection
  + OBE. When did I do this?
* WidgetEditor still comes up as Anchor every time.
  + Before I implemented WidgetEditor.last_widget to track this, but I didn't fix it with the update.
  + Done
* WidgetEditor should get focus
  + I have no idea what this means.
* The only thing remaining is finishing the testing.
  + Working on the first test.

5/20/2024 - Almost done
* Need to finish up the testing, but I have a problem with WHERE and WHY it is failing.
  + I added log and pause statements. 
  + It seems to be a problem with finding and dragging the image window to one side.
    - I found that the Verify View keyword was only looking at primary. 
    - I added a requirement to specify which window we are validating.
  + It seems that the delay for logging in RFGUIHelper is delaying the test. Oops.
  + That did it. TestMenus passed.
  + TestViews passed, too.
* Still having problems with the widget test.
  + OH MY! I finally took pictures of the first widget that worked and the subsequent one which didn't.
  + By overlapping them, I could see that the recall of the most recent widget type was different than the anchor in the first case which always was the same.
  + Working so much better.
  + Okay, I removed three of the scroll buttons, but it still crashed when we went to the checkbox. 
    - The test didn't crash, RFGUIHelper did.
* I was able to provoke the same error by adding a ton of widgets. Not sure why the error, but at least that worked.
  + I had to compare two or three side by side. No differences after all. Maybe the last one is just crashing.
  + In each case there are two lines where the initial values are input and then the all members once type-specific stuff is added.
  + In all but the last one, they all match. Here you can see the failure. No idea why.

      DEBUG 15:18:56-- Widget.__init__[62]: Universay members: Widget(945): {'name': '', 'view': 'main', 'type': 'Anchor', 'X': 111.0, 'Y': 3.0, 'width': 84.0, 'height': 16.0}
      DEBUG 15:18:56-- Widget.__init__[68]: All members: Widget(945): {'name': '', 'view': '', 'type': '', 'X': '', 'Y': '', 'width': '', 'height': ''}

  + I decided the best way to fix this is start with the stuff that is type specific and then add the rest of it.
    - Not sure why that worked, but it did.
    - Everything worked there.
* I want to do one more test that goes through the GIF and Watchers.
  * That was easy. The watchers worked great.
  * I don't have anything interesting to see with the gif tool, but it also works.
  * I'm happy with this and I can let it go at this point.
* Cleaning up. I'm using the AI as a reviewer again.
* I finished adding quality documentation to the rfghelper.resource file.

May 24, 2024
* Continuing with cleaning. AI is useless at reviewing large amounts of code.
* I ran into a bug. Deleting a view somehow doesn't completely work. Have to find out why.
* The error occurs when a widget exists on the view you delete. Shouldn't be a problem, but it is.
  - Ha! I actually found this #TODO other actions e.g. widgets in view
  - Fixed it, but now I need to add that in as a test case.
* Working on widgets
  - That didn't take too long.
* I added the tab onto my all-widgets image. I thought i already did that, but apparently not.

Could we integrate Log to Console with Banner, etc?
