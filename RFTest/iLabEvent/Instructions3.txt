1. Start with the same code we used from siteTest #2.

2. This time we will explore data driven testing where the same test can have parameters so that it serves
   for several different test cases. Robot Framework can do this natively or you can use one of several
   tools to import the data. In any case, the mechanisms are similar. We will look at what RF can do on its
   own.

3. To set up a group of related tests, you need to go into settings and consider any actions that need to
   be taken at four key periods
Suite Setup - this is before any tests occur; best used for setting up any default settings, doctrine, 
              validation, etc.
Suite Teardown - this is after all the tests have run; best used to collect final OQE, shut down connections, 
              etc.
Test Setup - This runs before each individual test; best used to reset or force a "new test" setting
Test Teardown - this runs after each individual test; best used to remove any "debris" from the test site
Test Template - this is the actual test.

Each of these actions can be used to designate a specific keyword. Because keywords can call other keywords, 
you have unlimited flexibility starting from that one keyword. You can designate any of these you want but
you MUST have the Test Template.
*** Settings ***
Library Selenium
Suite Setup  kw_Before All
Test Setup  kw_Check Inventory
Test Teardown  kw_Clear Status
Test Template kw_Run Test

If you run several tests, the order of keywords will look something like this.

Suite Setup
  Test Setup
    Test Template
  Test Teardown
  Test Setup
    Test Template
  Test Teardown
  ...
Suite Teardown

4. Under Test cases you will not have anything that looks like the usual keyword structure. Instead you
will have a set of DDT data. It is suggested that you use tabs between data points to make it obvious
at a glance if you miss one. Each test case starts with the name of the test case and then the same number of
parameters for each case. It is also suggested that you match variable titles on the first line to give
a header to this text-only table.

*** Test Cases ***	user		password	Worked		Name
Admin login		admin		admin		${TRUE}		Mr. Admin
Lowly user		dummy		password123	${TRUE}		Dumbo Jr
No user			${empty}	password456     ${FALSE}	--
No password		other		${empty}	${FALSE}	--

5. In DDT it is important to include the expected outcome as part of your test. These outcomes can be
used to validate your test on the fly as you are gathering the OQE. In this case, I used a true/false 
variable just to indicate if the login was successful. I also included the name I expect to see in the
account section of the page. If I don't get in, I won't check the name (last two cases). I can validate
these results in my test.

6. Now I want to write up a test procedure that will be open to these parameters. This will be the keyword
I write in for Test Template. On the first line I have to put all of the parameters in the test cases.
I do not have to use the same NAME for the parameters, but I do need to have the same NUMBER.
*** Keywords ***
kw_Login Test
    [Arguments]		${user}		${password}	${worked}	${name}

7. Go through and write your test as before. Use the input data to drive the test, validate it, and report out.
   Some pro tips:

* In the test you can use ${TEST NAME} to get that first bit of text (e.g. "Lowly user") that describes
  the test case, so make the test names informative.
* If you want a new row for each test case in the report GUI, use the New Test Event keyword to
  generate that row.
* You can also use the Data Break keyword to put a dark blue bar between different sections of a test report.
* Between new row, box and data break rows you should be able to automatically format a good report for the outcome.
* Just as we did with TEARDOWN in the last event, you can use ${KEYWORD STATUS} and ${KEYWORD MESSAGE}
  in the teardown to report on overal status.
* You can capture pass/fail on all your assertions and add blocks to that row as often as you please. 
  This might be a way to add to your OQE output. This is a little more program-y but the logic can be
  as complicated or simple as you like.
  ${a1} =    Assert OQE Value    ${HTML}    Verify link    ${href}    ${HREF}
  Record Test Case    --    Check login matched    ${a1}    --
* Alternatively, you could use multiple keywords and take advantage of ${KEYWORD STATUS} etc. in each
  teardown.
