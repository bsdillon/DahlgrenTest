1. Enact the test manually to determine the procedure and OQE
* Open a browser
* Navigate to https://www.dvidshub.net/
* Note the title on the window
* Note the appearance of the site
* Close the browser

2. Create a Robot Framework Script which has the following required elements.
*** Settings ***
*** Variables ***
*** Keywords ***
*** Test Cases ***

3. To get access to the python code for browser access through the Selenium tool, 
   add this under settings
Library   SeleniumLibrary

4. Add three variables for the site in question. We could do this with any website 
   or browser, but for consistency the group should use these for our test. You can
   give any name to the variables that you want. All variables have the form ${NAME}.
The name of the browser: Chrome
The URL you navigated to: https://www.dvidshub.net/
The title of the page: DVIDS - Defense Visual Information Distribution Service

5. We will create test cases to automate the manual test you did above. Let's work
   here first by answering some questions. 

   Which of these are test STEPS and which are OQE?
* Open a browser
* Navigate to https://www.dvidshub.net/
* Note the title on the window
* Note the appearance of the site
* Close the browser

   From the RF Selenium site what are the keywords that can effect each of these 
   actions? This may require some searching.
   https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html#Browser%20and%20Window

6. Create test cases for each of the actions. You can combine some of them if
   you like. The anatomy of a test case is:
Some Name for the Test Case
    Some Keyword    Any parameter you need

A blank line comes between each test case
    Four spaces precede     each line
    Always use for spaces    before any additional parameters

7. Run the test from the command line. You can verify the pass/fail of each
   test step as it runs (you will see PASS in green or FAIL in red). After 
   the test is done, you can read the automatically generated log. Watch
   for the screen capture in the log.
