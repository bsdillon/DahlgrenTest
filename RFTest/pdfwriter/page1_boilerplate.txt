Robot Framework is a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) library available on the web for all. It is used to automate and report on software testing. By integrating additional tools and libraries new testing capabilities can be integrated. Sikuli, for example, is another COTS tool which automates screen and keyboard actions. When integrated with Robot Framework the combination supports testing of all Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). This report is the template for a standard report without specifics about the system or specific test case.
