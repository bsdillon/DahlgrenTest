  (ex. C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts) and add those to the Path variable.

Tesseract requires an install of the tool and the python library
Tesseract is already part of Linux, but does need to be installed and the path set.
The process for installation on windows includes code and compilation. Not going
to document it here, but we are using version 3.0.2 which is the last one they 
updated and a windows install. The modern version is 5.2.0 as of July 2022.

You need to install the pytesseract library
- pip install pytesseract
This installs Pillow at the same time.
