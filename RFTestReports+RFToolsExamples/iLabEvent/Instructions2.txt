1. Start from test script 1 (i.e. the previous lesson).

2. Consider moving any useful keywords into the resource file. This is a step that increases
   the reusability of the test. The basic strategy is to work on creating some test capability
   and then consider how to turn it into a reusable "lego" block for future tests. To do this,
   it is helpful to identify parameters in the keyword. A keyword with no parameters is almost
   literally a one trick pony. With a parameter it can be used for many different things.

Find More Button
   ${id} =    Get Element Attribute	css:#footer div div div a    id
   Log     Found ${id}
   I don't necessarily want to log everything. Just return the value
                                        The css statement is something we could consider as a parameter.
                                                                     This is the attribute we want to capture and another parameter.

Find Tag and Get Attribute
   [Arguments]    ${CSS-IDENTIFIER}    ${ATTRIBUTE-NAME}
   ${value} =    Get Element Attribute	${CSS-IDENTIFIER}    ${ATTRIBUTE-NAME}
   [Return]    ${value}
Now we have two paramters (arguments) and we are using them to get the attribute

3. After building the keyword from your previous work, call that keyword and verify that the
   test still works as before. Steps 2 and 3 are call REFACTORING - changing the form, but
   not the function of the code. In this case we can make a change to the form of the code
   which will make it more reusable and we always test to make sure it still works the way
   it used to. Do this one small bit at a time so you have a limited number of variables that
   change in each experiment. This simple test verifies that it works as expected.

Test Keyword
   ${id} =    Find Tag and Get Attribute    css:#footer div div div a    id
   Log     Found ${id}

4. In this test we are going to introduce the reporting GUI and use some of those tools to 
   improve the test report beyond what Robot Framework offers natively. We will start by editing
   a couple of files to set things up.
IN THE TEST SCRIPT - Point to the OQE resource file
Resource   ./../OQE/DataExtraction.resource

IN THE RESOURCE FILE - Give the name of two test files we will use.
Library   kw_DataExtraction.py    ./../OQE/test2.js    ./../OQE/test2other.js    WITH NAME    oqe
Alter the file locations where were will put the data.

IN THE HTML FILE - Change the data source file location to match
    <script id = "dataSourceFile" src="./../OQE/test2.js"></script>

5. We will run a few new test lines just to make sure everything is connected properly.
Setup OQE
   Test Check
   ${something} =    Prove it works
   Log    ${something}
   Archive Any Previous Data
   Insert Dummy Test Data
The log should indicate that Test Check and Prove it works. The new test2.js file should
also be created and you will see the dummy data in the HTML GUI. If you see these effects, 
then you can start working with the OQE GUI.

6. Replace the OQE gathering steps from your test with references to the newly linked OQE GUI.
   Some of the OQE keywords to consider are:
* Assert OQE Value    ${TEST NAME}    <<STEP NAME>>    <<ACTUAL>>    <<EXPECTED>>
  This keyword is used to directly compare the actual and expected value. Name the step
  something that describes the assertian.
  Ex. Assert OQE Value    ${TEST NAME}    IFF Check    ${IFF Found}    1234
  
* Record Data    ${TEST NAME}    <<STEP NAME>>    <<DATA>>
  This keyword is used to log data without pass/fail judgement. End each datum with a ';'
  This could be a way to record the whole contents of a message or data about some event.
  Ex. Record Data    ${TEST NAME}    MT-121    ${mt}.Number; ${mt}.Source; ${mt}.Dest;

* Capture Element Image    <<IDENTIFIER>>    ${TEST NAME}    <<STEP NAME>>
* Capture Screen Image    ${TEST NAME}    <<STEP NAME>>
  Both of these keywords use similar conventions to capture screen shots. The images will
  be captured in the HTML report.
  Ex. Capture Element Image    hookTrack.LTN    ${TEST NAME}    Verify LTN

* [Teardown]    Record Test Case    ${CASE NAME}    ${STEP NAME}    ${TEST STATUS}    ${TEST MESSAGE}
  This keyword should be used at the end of each test case. It captures the overal pass/fail
  status of the test case. You may gather pass/fail criteria with the keywords above, but
  the test itself may fail for other reasons which will be captured here in the error message.
  You can choose to specify either the test case as whole or some specific step in the case.
  Ex. Record Test Case    ${CASE NAME}    --    ${TEST STATUS}    ${TEST MESSAGE}
  Ex. Record Test Case    --    ${STEP NAME}    ${TEST STATUS}    ${TEST MESSAGE}
