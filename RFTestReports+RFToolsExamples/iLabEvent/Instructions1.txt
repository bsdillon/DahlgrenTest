1. Start from the script created in step 0.

2. Open the last test script and save again as a resource file. No specific naming
   convention exists, but we prefer to name all robot files as .robot and a resource
   file as resourceXXXXX.robot.

3. In the resource file we will create keywords from the test steps. Basically, these
   look exactly like the test steps, but these can be called as keywords in another
   test. You are free to rename the keyword to any word or even sentence that is
   meaningful to you in a future test.
Open and Verify Site
   Open Browser   ${SITE URL}   ${BROWSER}
   Title Should Be    ${TITLE}
   Capture Page Screenshot    EMBED

4. Recreate the effect of test 0 using the resource file. You will need to add a line
   to the settings that points to the new resource file. Then you can replace the
   contents of the test step with a call to the newly create keywords. Make sure the
   test still runs and passes all tests.
Resource  ./resource1.robot

5. Learn to use developer tools. Open the DVIDS site in a open browser, click the 
   three vertical dots or prest CTRL+SHIFT+I. Across the top of the new window there 
   are tabs. Click on 'Elements'.

6. If you run your mouse over code elements on the right you will see sections on
   the left highlighted in blue. We want to use this tool to find the "view background 
   image" button near the bottom of the page. You will need to expand the following:
     <div id="body_content"></div
       <div id="footer"></div>
         <div class="uk-container uk-container-center"></div>
           <div class="uk-grid"></div>
             <div class="uk-width-medium-10-10"></div>
               <a href="...." id="view_background_image_link"></a>

7. You can use a variety of new keywords to find the link "...." from that button.
   Note that the id "footer" is on the div tag around that button. Under that are
   three more div tags and then an a. So we can use a couple of different routes
   to find the footer and navigate to the a.

Find More Button
   ${id}=	Get Element Attribute	css:#footer div div div a    id
   Log     Found ${id}

This one uses Cascading Style Sheet (css) syntax to find elements.
* css:#footer div div div a
      #this is the id we can find in the developer tools
              div div div a
              This is the list of elements under the footer

Find More Button 2
   ${id}=	Execute Javascript    return document.getElementById("footer").firstElementChild.firstElementChild.firstElementChild.firstElementChild.id;
   Log     Found ${id}
This one uses Javascript code if you prefer. We start the same way 
by finding the footer, then we use repeated "firstElementChild" to
go down four layers.

8. You are free to do this and other actions to help you find elements. For more
information visit these sites:

9. Use your new skills to:
* Find one of the top menu items and Click Element on it
* Find the search bar and use Input Text to set the search text
* After you type something into the search, find and specific text on the autocomplete
* Find and click a link at the bottom of the page

10. What OQE do you have to verify that these actions happened? There are lots of
    options like Capture Page Screenshot or Capture Element Screenshot and lots of
    "should" statements to verify contents like Title Should Be.
