1. Find a method for programmatically creating standard UML models from data.
* Option A - A library that can create a standard file for UML-based tools.
* Option B - An open library that can interface directly with a UML-based tool.
* Option C - A prioprietary library like that in Option B.
* Option D - New development of a library described in Option A.

The ideal final product will be compatible with any of several commercial 
UML-based modeling tools. See the site below for a list of these tools.
Open source and freeware is preferred over proprietary and licensed software.

2. Demonstrate a minimum viable product that can take a CSV file of data and
generate a model as output.
* Toy data can be manufactured for the purpose.
* Suggested models (https://tallyfy.com/uml-diagram/) include:
  * Activity/Swim lane diagram - useful for showing interactions between different systems or users with different responsiblities
  * Use case diagram - shows data like the activity diagram; interactions exist without sequence or relational context.
  * Sequence diagram - Similar to activity diagram; components exist only during interactions.
  * Communication diagram - similar ot use case diagram with sequential and type data imposed on connections between components.

The ideal final product will be implemented in python or a similar scripting language.
