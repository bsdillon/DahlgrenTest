#-cannot color and higlight in/ out of a boz at the same time 
###############################

-User document how to use library/gui/server (August 1st)

-Edit Squence diagram changes so that connections between nodes are highlighted(edges) and not just the nodes themselves

-support for Enums or interfaces or other forms of classes

-ability to combine nodes into one (Linear Diagrams)

-ability to put classes inside of one another(Mostly need to look into how to visualize this how to actually do it in the Library is pretty straightforward)

-Add parameters for functions (dont know how I forgot this is represented in class diagrams but should be fairly easy to implement. Should look into if this is the
spot where the library should store connections for method graphs)
